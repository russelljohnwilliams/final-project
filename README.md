User section - Here is where a user can create a new image link.


More ideas could include

* add tags to an image
* on Contributors pages, next to each image would display similar images linked by any user, based upon useage of the same tags
* create the site to have less pages, log-in and uploading images could be a pop-up overlay rather than a seperate page.
* ability to upload images as well as link to an image.
* Look into storing linked images incase a broken link occures.
* Ability to view each image on it's own page.
* Allow conversations to start around an image with a comments box on image page.
